# Tapas Dash | Backend Mercenary

### I fix the expensive problems your last developer created.

Let's be honest: Your frontend looks great, but your backend is holding on for dear life. That's where I come in. I take fragile, chaotic codebases and turn them into boring, reliable profit engines.

I build specifically for **FinTech** and **SaaS**, because when money is moving, you can't afford a "whoops."

### The doctrine
* **Clean Architecture > Clever Hacks.** I write code for the poor soul who has to read it in 6 months (even if that's me).
* **Performance is a Feature.** If it loads in over 200ms, it's broken.
* **The Stack:** `Node.js`, `TypeScript`, `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB`, `Next.js`.

### Contact
I'm picky about projects, but I'm always open to interesting conversations.
